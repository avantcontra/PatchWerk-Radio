## Unfortunately PatchWerk Radio is off the air

After having had patchwerk running for a not inconsiderable amount of time now, I realise that I haven't been giving it the attention it deserves for quite a while now. I'm taking it off the air before it becomes an even more run-down project of mine. All the code and patches are still available and if anybody else wants to take this up then I'm more than happy to give them any support.

Most of the patches have been contributed by other (much more talented) people. You can find more info about them and what they've contributed on the Authors and Patches pages respectivley.

There's a reasonably good rundown of how PatchWerk works here and some guidlines for creating your own patches are also available.
