## Welcome to PatchWerk Radio

PatchWerk Radio is a generative radio station that streams audio 24/7 (assuming nothing's broken). It runs on Python and PureData and all the patches and source code are freely available.

You can listen in on this [stream](http://patchwerk.rumblesan.com:8000/radio.ogg)

Most of the patches have been contributed by other (much more talented) people. You can find more info about them and what they've contributed on the Authors and Patches pages respectivley.

There's a reasonably good rundown of how PatchWerk works here and some guidlines for creating your own patches are also available.
